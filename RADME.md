# PWO++ Language

### About
This repository is going to be a simple imperative language based on one of my lecturer's styles of writing pseudo code.

This language will have implemented:
- loops
- conditionals
- comparator "almost equal"
- functions
- recurence functions
- very mathematical syntax

Besides that I'm implementing lexer, parser, interpreter in OCaml

### Example of code written in PWO++:

```Java
Sum(x_1...x_n):
	S:=x_1
	FOR i=2 TO n:
		S:=x_i
	RETURN(S)
```
